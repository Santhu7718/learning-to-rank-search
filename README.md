# ðŸš€ learning-to-rank-search

A machine learning project to rank search results using the LETOR dataset and LightGBM LambdaRank.

***

## Project Description

This project implements a Learning-to-Rank system for search engines using the LETOR MQ2008 dataset and LightGBMâ€™s LambdaRank algorithm. Given a search query and candidate documents, the model predicts the best ranking order to maximize relevance for users.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Santhu7718/learning-to-rank-search.git
cd learning-to-rank-search
```

#### Setup virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

***

## Running the Pipeline

### 1. Train and evaluate the model

```bash
python -m scripts.run_pipeline
```
*Produces NDCG scores for each fold.*

### 2. Save your model for the demo
> Model is saved as `model_fold1.pkl` after running training.

***

## Interactive Demo with Streamlit

### 1. Run the Streamlit demo UI

```bash
streamlit run demo_streamlit.py
```

### 2. Enter paths for a test file and a trained model  
### 3. Select a query ID to view ranked documents for that search

***

## Approach

- **Dataset:** LETOR MQ2008 (benchmark for ranking tasks)
- **Algorithm:** LightGBM LambdaRank (optimized for NDCG)
- **Evaluation Metric:** NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)
- **Cross-Validation:** 5-fold

***

## Results

- **Average Test NDCG:** e.g., `0.5340`

Individual Fold Results:
- Fold1: 0.4878
- Fold2: 0.5081
- Fold3: 0.5260
- Fold4: 0.5775
- Fold5: 0.5705

***

## How It Works

- The model learns to assign higher scores to documents more relevant to a query.
- Evaluated using NDCGâ€”top results are most useful to users.
- UI lets users select a query and see model rankings live.
